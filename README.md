# Overview of Project

In this project used d3.js, Plotly, and JavaScript to create a dashboard with various plots to visualize a JSON dataset. The dataset was taken from a study about the biodiversity of microbes found in bellybuttons. By choosing a test subject ID, the whole dashboard is updated to visualize the data for that test subject.
